# Corona Virus Dashboard


```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "##",
  fig.width = 8, 
  fig.height = 5.5,

The **R-TimeSeriesAnalysis** folder provides R/RMD files for time series analysis. 

See corresponding subfolders `Climate` and `Corona-Virus`.

## R code

My own R package `pkgTS` for TimeSeries Functions 
is stored on GitHub (https://github.com/WoVollmer/pkgTS) and can be downloaded by

`devtools::install_github("WoVollmer/pkgTS")` 

`library(pkgTS)`
