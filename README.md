# Climate Data Analysis and Corona Virus Dashboard

The **R-TimeSeriesAnalysis** folder provides R/RMD files for time series
analysis.

See corresponding subfolders `Climate` and `Corona-Virus`.

## R code

My own R package `pkgTS` for TimeSeries Functions is stored on GitHub
(<https://github.com/WoVollmer/pkgTS>) and can be downloaded by

`devtools::install_github("WoVollmer/pkgTS")`

`library(pkgTS)`
